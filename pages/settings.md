Now is the time to consider the setting of your horrific story. You want something extraordinary but doable with your very limited financial means. Several options lay before you:

1. Your old highschool. You hate the place and thus would love to sublime its macabre atmosphere. Plus you know the shool principal since itâ€™s your mother. 
2. The town supermarket. It is closed on sundays and the meat counter would be an ideal place for a slaughter scene.
3. The hospital. You broke your arm when you were 9 and were send there. A horror story in itself.
