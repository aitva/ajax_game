title: Super8
```
You rush to the nearest ATM and buy from this dodgy store a camero. Not any camera actually: a Super8 that was only waiting for a real talent like your humble self.

In the box your find a manual  that explains how to use the camera. Scrolling through the pages, you realize it is much more that just a manual. I will be your handbook for this whole adventure. You can access it by typing GET /handbook.
